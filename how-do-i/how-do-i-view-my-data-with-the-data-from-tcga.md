# How do I view my data with the data from TCGA?

## Adding in new samples

We apologize but we don't provide a simple way to do this because of the batch effects that would be present when combining most data across studies. You will need to download the data you wish to combine from TCGA, combine it yourself outside of Xena, and then load it into your own Xena hub.

{% hint style="info" %}
Download TCGA data through [our data pages](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

## Adding in more data on TCGA patient's samples, such as new subtype calls

1. Load your data into your own Xena hub, making sure to select the cohort that you want to view your data side-by-side with when loading it.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Sample names and format are study specific. You will need to match what we already in Xena.

[Our data pages have more information about the sample names for a study](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/)

## Genomic Signatures

Note that if you want to view a genomic signature on our gene expression data, you can do so using our [genomic signature feature.](../overview-of-features/genomic-signatures.md)
