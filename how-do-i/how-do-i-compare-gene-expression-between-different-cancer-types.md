# How do I compare gene expression between different cancer types?

{% hint style="info" %}
This page assumes that you are already viewing more than one cancer type together in the same view. Please see the help page '[How do I view multiple types of cancer together](how-do-i-view-more-than-one-type-of-cancer-together.md)' to get started with this.



If there are cancer types in view that you do not want to investigate, you will need to filter them out. Please see the help page '[How do I filter to just one cancer type](how-do-i-filter-to-just-one-cancer-type.md)' to get started with this.
