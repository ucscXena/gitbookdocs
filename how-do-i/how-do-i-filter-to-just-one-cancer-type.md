# How do I filter to just one cancer type

## Generalized Steps

1\. Add the phenotype column that details the cancer type

{% hint style="info" %}
The phenotype column will vary depending on which study you choose. See below for specific column names
{% endhint %}

2\. Search for the cancer type you are interested in, making sure that it is listed in the phenotype column. Click the Filter + subgroup menu next to the search bar and select 'Keep Samples'.
