# How do I filter to just one cancer type

## Generalized Steps

### 1. Add the phenotype column that details the cancer type

Please see the study specific instructions for which column

### 2. Use the filter functionality to select the cancer type

Using the filter search bar:

Search for the cancer type you are interested in, making sure that it is listed in the phenotype column.
