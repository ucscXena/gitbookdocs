# How do I make more than 2 subgroups?

This page builds upon the basics of making subgroups:

{% page-ref page="how-do-i-make-subgroups.md" %}

To make more than 2 sample subgroups, enter multiple search terms, such as 'C:&gt;15' into the search box and separate each search term with a ';'.

{% hint style="info" %}
Enter multiple search terms and separate each search term with a **';'**.
{% endhint %}

This is a great way to divide a numerical column into multiple subgroups.

## An example

For instance, if you have column C that ranges from 7.3 to 12 and you want to have 3 groups: 7.3 - 9, 9 - 10, and 10 - 12, you would enter:

C:&gt;9 ; C:&gt;10

into the search bar and then choose 'New subgroup column'.
