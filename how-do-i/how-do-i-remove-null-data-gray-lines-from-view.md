# How do I remove null data \(gray lines\) from view?

Sometimes not all patient's samples in a dataset have data. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a particular patient's sample did not undergo an analysis. In this case, we use gray, or 'null' to show that there is no data. 

To remove null data use the 'Remove samples with nulls' shortcut in the filter menu.
