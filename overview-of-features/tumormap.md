# TumorMap

UCSC TumorMap is a separate project developed by the Stuart Lab at UCSC. We link to them to help users gain another perspective on the data they are seeing in Xena. From their [Overview page](https://tumormap.ucsc.edu/help/overview.html):

> TumorMap is a tool that enables grouping samples based on their omic signatures in a visually accessible way. Similar to dimensionality reduction methods, Tumor Map method takes a high-dimensional omics space and produces a two dimensional visualization. Unlike most dimensionality reduction methods, the TumorMap method is able to combine multiple types of omics data \(e.g. mRNA expression and methylation data types in a single map\). Furthermore, TumorMap is an interactive tool that allows navigating through a tumor landscape that represents a heterogeneous multi-dimensional and multi-platform omic space of oncogenic signatures.

> In the TumorMap, each node is a sample and clusters of samples indicate groups with similar oncogenic signatures and genomic alteration events. The samples in a map may be colored by various molecular, clinical, diagnostic, prognostic, and phenotypic annotations \(e.g. tumor type, molecular subtype, etc.\) to visualize associations with the data type used in clustering.
