# Data Use Agreement

As Xena does not generate any of the data it displays, there is no Xena Data Use Agreement. If you use data from Xena, [please cite us](cite-us.md).

Please check with the original data providers (e.g. the GDC) for any data use restrictions. You can see more about our data providers by clicking on the [Hub page](https://xenabrowser.net/hub/).
