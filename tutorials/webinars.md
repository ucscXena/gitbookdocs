## Introduction to Xena for bulk sequencing data: June 5th, 2025 10am-12pm PT

This webinar will be on **June 5th, 2025, 10am-12pm PT.**

In this webinar we will explore Xena's core functionalities for bulk sequencing data including&#x20;

* Visualizing mutation, expression, and copy number variation for a gene, group of genes, or chromosome
* Visualizing clinical/phenotype data
* Running a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
* Creating charts and analyses with accompanying statistics
* Running a Differential Gene Expression analysis

All analyses will be done on publicly available data. As time permits, weâ€™ll also do a brief demonstration of how to explore your own bulk sequencing data within Xena.

The webinar will run for 1.5 hours, followed by 30 minutes for Q\&A.
